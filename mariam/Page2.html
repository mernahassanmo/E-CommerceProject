            Eating pasta isn't actually that bad for you (thank you, science!).
            Still, there's an art to picking the perfect box of pasta that will
            fill you up without leaving you bloated: “More often than not, I'll
            look for a 100 percent whole-grain option, with at least four grams
            of fiber and six grams of protein per serving,” says Elizabeth Ann
            Shaw, R.D.N. Oh, and you shouldn't see off-the-charts sugar or
            sodium counts, either. “There shouldn't really be any more than a
            gram or two of total sugars, and no more than 10 mg sodium,” says
            Maggie Moon, R.D.N. and author of The MIND Diet. That's right, there
            are plenty of healthy pastas out there (and no, this isn't an
            article about zoodles). Read on for seven healthy boxed pastas you
            should try.

            You might think red meat is off-limits if you're concerned about
            your health or trying to watch your weight, but leaner cuts of beef
            can be part of a healthy diet in moderation. While the tastiest cuts
            of beef are often ones with more fat, you won't necessarily have to
            sacrifice flavor when choosing lean cuts of beef. Use this guide on
            cuts of beef to make smart choices,Wondering which cuts of beef are
            the leanest? Check the label. The labels on cuts of beef are
            considered nutrition claims, so they're subject to government
            regulations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates
            whether cuts of beef can be labeled as "lean" or "extra lean" based
            on their fat and cholesterol content.
